Any applications in this folder are to be used with a Python 3 runtime interpreter.

You can test python by trying this command:
    python --version

If the version is 2.x and not 3.x, try this command:
    python3 --version

If that doesn't work at all, you can install python from:
    1. Microsoft Store (Windows)
    2. https://python.org website (Windows , MacOS, Linux)
    3. command: "sudo app install python3" (Ubuntu / Debian Linux)

Once Python 3 is installed, use a command prompt to go to the folder which this file is in.

If you have both Python 2 AND Python 3, run these commands:
    pip3 install requests
    pip3 install dotmap

    Finally, run the program!
    python3 accounts.py

If python --version returns a 3.x version number, run these commands instead:
    pip install requests
    pip install dotmap

    Finally, run the program!
    python accounts.py
